#Changes
smc_init_sim/smc_particle_sim
  - Changed the simulation of days until hosipitalisation so that all incidences at time t are allocated to future days when simulation of t 
  - Removed predict_from as input, not used
  - included insT as output, delay of testing, same structure as insH
smc_loglik_mem/smc_loglik
 Removed Hosp_INS and INS, not used
 Included q_test as input, probabilities for delays on testing
 Included test_data as input
 included pi_test as input, pi_0,pi_1

run_smc_model_mem.r:
  Changed prob_h to be a vector of two, if not get NA on weights.
  
  
  
  
  
  
   Removed the use of hospD as global variable, rather use hosp_data as sent in to the function
  Also then removed hospD in the run-script
